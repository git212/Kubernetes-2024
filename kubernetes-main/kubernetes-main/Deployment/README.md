### Deployment
```sh
•	Replication controller Replica set is not able to do update and rollback apps in the cluster.
•	A deployment object acts as a supervisor for pods, giving you fine-grained control over how
        and when a new pod is rolled out, updated or rolled back to a previous state.
•	When using the deployment object, we first define the state of the app, then k8s cluster
       schedules mentioned app instances onto specific individual nodes.
•	A deployment provides declarative updates for pods and replicaset.
•	k8s then monitors, if the node hosting an instance goes down or pod is deleted then the
       deployment controller replaces it.
•	This provides a self-healing mechanism to address machine failure or maintenance.
```
### Deployment Use Case
```sh
•	Create a deployment to rollout a replicaSet.
•	Rollback to an earlier deployment revision
•	Scale up the deployment to facilitates more load
•	Pause the deployment to apply multiple fixes to its PodTemplateSpec and then name it to a new rollout
•	Clean-up the older replicaSet which is not required anymore
```
### Deployment commands
```sh
kubectl decribe deploy <deployment name>
kubectl scale --replicas=1 deploy <deployment name> # To scale up or scale down
Kubectl exec <pod_name> -it -- /bin/bash # Accessing the pod container
```
### Deployment Rollout Status
```sh
kubectl rollout status deployment <deployment name>
```
###  Deployment history
```sh
kubectl rollout history deployment <deployment name>
```
### Rollout the version from v1 to v2
```sh
Edit the image and apply again the manifest
kubectl set image deployment/nginx-deployment nginx=nginx:1.161
```
### To add a change cause
```sh
kubectl annotate deployment/mydeployments kubernetes.io/change-cause="update image version from v1 to v2"
```
### Deployment Rollback
```sh
kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment name>
```
### To see the details of each revision
```sh
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment name> --revision=3
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment name> --revision=2
kubectl rollout history deployment/<deployment name> --revision=1
```
### Deployment Rollback to a specific version
kubectl rollout undo deployment <deployment name> --to-revision=1
